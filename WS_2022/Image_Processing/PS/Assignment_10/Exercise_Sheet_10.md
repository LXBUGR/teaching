# Exercise Sheet 10



## Exercise 10 (5 points)

This assignment is meant to be a preparation for the lecture exam as it requires a basic understanding of the various segmentation techniques discussed in the lecture.

Go through the list of segmentation-related functions and read the documentation:

- https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.segmentation.html

  

As you will see, many of the segmentation techniques discussed in the lecture are also implemented in scikit-image in some form. Sometimes this is fairly obvious, e.g., in case of the `watershed()`. Sometimes it's less obvious, e.g., in case of `felzenswalb()`. 

Now read through the function documentation and do the following ...

- Ask yourself whether the implemented function is similar to any of the segmentation technique discussed in the lecture. If yes, recall how the segmentation technique discussed in the lecture works and briefly summarize it (the version discussed in the lecture)

  **Note:** The document does also list some "utility" functions (e.g., `expand_labels`, `clear_border`). You can simply ignore those functions.

- If possible, try to identify the key difference between the implemented version and the simplified version which we discussed in the lecture. The many goal is to understand the explained in the lecture works, though.



**Submission:**

Submit your notes on Blackboard until 23rd Jan (08:00). In the last PS (also on 23rd Jan) we will then discuss the techniques once again.
